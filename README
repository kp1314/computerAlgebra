You should state here which report figures were generated by which code projects 
and what configuration file was used for each figure, if appropriate.
Remember to try to keep seperate parts of the project in separate folders.

Figures 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and 1e, which are cobweb diagram for the Veruhlst map with different r-values, were created using the /CobwebDiagrams/VerhulstMapCobweb.m file.

Figure 2, which is the bifurcation diagram for the Verhulst map where all iterations of Xk were plotted, was created on Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/VerhulstAllXk.m file.

Figures 3 and 5a (The same figure), which is the bifurcation diagram for the Verhulst map where only the larger iterations of Xk were plotted, was created on Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/MAINVerhulstCode.m file.

Figure 4, which shows the first points on the Verhulst map where period doubling occurs, was created on Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/MAINVerhulstPointsCode.m file.

Figures 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, and 5f, which are bifurcation diagrams for the Verhulst map like figure 3, but with differing initial x values, were created on Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/VerhulstChangingXo.m file. Each of these figures were created by changing the initial x value (Xo variable in the file) to 0.5, 1, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5, resepectively. Figure 5a, which has an inital x value of 0.1, is the same as figure 3 (mentioned above).

Figure 6, which is the bifurcation diagram for the logistic map where all iterations of Xk were plotted, was created on Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/LogisticAllXk.m file.

Figures 7 and 9b (The same figure), which is the bifurcation diagram for the logistic map where only the larger iterations of Xk were plotted, was created on Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/MAINLogisticCode.m file.

Figure 8, which shows the first points on the logistic map where period doubling occurs, was created on Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/MAINLogisticPointsCode.m file.

Figure 9a, 9c, 9d, 9e, and 9f, which are bifurcation diagrams for the logistic map like figure 7, but with differing initial x values, were created on Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/LogisticChangingXo.m file. Each of these figures were created by changing the initial x value (Xo variable in the file) to 0, 0.9, 1, 1.1, and 1.4, resepectively. Figure 9b, which has an inital x value of 0.1, is the same as figure 7 (mentioned above).

Figure 10, which is the bifurcation diagram for the trigonometric map where only the larger iterations of Xk were plotted, was created on Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/MAINTrigonometricCode.m file.

Figure 11, which shows the first points on the trigonometric map where period doubling occurs, was created on Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/MAINTrigonometricPointsCode.m file.

Figures 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, 12e, and 12f, which are bifurcation diagrams for the trigonometric map like figure 10, but with differing initial x values, were created on Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/TrigonometricChangingXo.m file. Each of these figures were created by changing the initial x value (Xo variable in the file) to 0, 1.5, 3.14, 3.15, 6.28, and 6.29, resepectively.

Figure 13, which is a zoomed in version of figure 3, showing the self-similarity of the Verhulst map by zooming in on the middle branch of the 3-cycle, was created in Matlab using the /NonLinearMapsCode/VerhulstFractal.m file.

Figure 15, which shows the Mandelbrot set, was created in Java using the /Mandelbrot Set Java Code/Mandelbrot Set Classes/src/Mandelbrot.java

Figure 16, which shows the graph for the colouring scheme of the Mandelbrot set in figure 15, was created in Microsoft Excel, and it's file location is /MandelbrotSet/colourgraph.png.

Figures 17a, 17b, 17c, and 17d, which are Julia sets, were created in Java using /Mandelbrot Set Java Code/Mandelbrot Set Classes/src/Julia1.java, /Mandelbrot Set Java Code/Mandelbrot Set Classes/src/Julia2.java, /Mandelbrot Set Java Code/Mandelbrot Set Classes/src/Julia3.java, /Mandelbrot Set Java Code/Mandelbrot Set Classes/src/Julia4.java, resepctively.

Figures 18a,18b,18c which are zoomed in images of the Mandelbrot set fringe, were created in Matlab using /MandelbrotSetMatlabCode/Zoom1.m, MandelbrotSetMatlabCode/Zoom2.m, MandelbrotSetMatlabCode/Zoom3.m respectively.

Figure 20, which shows data for Boll's results, was created in Java using the /BollsResults/NumIterations/src/Main.java, /BollsResults/NumIterations/src/numIterations.java and /BollsResults/NumIterations/src/Table.java files.

Figures 22a, 22b, 22c, 22d, 22e, 22f, 22g, and 22h, which are Multibrot sets with the exponent as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively, were created in Matlab using the /MandelbrotSetMatlabCode/MandelbrotSetCode.m file, and the exponent part of the code was simply changed to create each of these figures.
