Put dots on 3 main ones DONE

Figures for not just large Xk for all 3 DONE

Do different Xo values:

Verhulst - 0, (0.1 already got), 0.5, 1, 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 DONE

Logistic - 0, (0.1 already got), 0.9, 1, 1.1, 1.4 DONE

Trigonometric - 0, (0.1 already got), 1.5, 3.14, 3.15, 6.28, 6.29 (Talk about can't get exactly pi) DONE

Zoom in on verhulst middle 3-cycle DONE

Maybe show more of trigonometric past r = 3 HMMMM
